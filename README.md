Cleveland Browns Trivia
Created during Week 5 of Case Western Reserve Coding Bootcamp. The challenge was to create a timed trivia game. Only 15 seconds were alotted to each question. After all of the questions were finished, the final scoreboard of how well you did would appear.

Motivation
I wanted to create a Cleveland Browns trivia game that was fun but still included a few questions that might challenge fans.
